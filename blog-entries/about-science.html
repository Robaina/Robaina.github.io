            <p>Why is biology different?</p>
          </div>

          <article class="blog-content">
            <p>I have heard some physicists complain about the very nature of biology as a science. It is not a science &mdash; they say &mdash; it is only about <em>describing</em> reality and not about finding models that generalize and simplify the phenomena we see. Sometimes they even continue &mdash; If only physicists were to make biology then it <em>would</em> be a science. But, how accurate is this statement? Let's discuss about it. Full disclaimer: I'm a biologist :).</p>

           <p>Physics studies the processes that occur in the universe at a fundamental level. Living organisms are made out of ordinary matter, utterly atoms, utterly(er) made out of only three fundamental particles: top quarks, down quarks and electrons. That's it. Now, physicists have developed a remarkably accurate theory which predicts the whereabouts and movements &mdash; rather their probabilities &mdash; of these fundamental particles. They have properties: charge, mass, strong nuclear property?, weak nuclear property? and there are forces which act on those properties: electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force and gravity. </p>
