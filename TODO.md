# Some stuff I want to do
1. <s>Fix footer at the bottom once and for all</s>
2. Add logo animation to loading page
3. Add a more interesting artwork to home page
4. <s>Change fonts to more appealing ones</s>
5. <s>Add light mode/dark mode</s>

# General notes
1. I tried to use only css to animate the settings button and open the list. Unfortunately, I cannot hide it back with css only and when combining JS and CSS I don't get the desired effect. So I'm using JS now. Remove the input and label fields and place the icon directly instead.
