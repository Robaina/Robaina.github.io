# Some stuff I want to do
1. Add a more interesting artwork to home page
2. Make apps grid flexible, same as Research
3. Add MTA paper as abandoned/interesting research tag (in red)
4. Blog!
5. Automatically display blog entries on load with js. Sort entries by date or by topic tag. Topic tag can be coded within the post html. Js could look at tag and sort elements accordingly. A date must be added to each blog entry.
