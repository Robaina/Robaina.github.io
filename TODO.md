# Some stuff I want to do
* Add a more interesting artwork to home page
* Add MTA paper as abandoned/interesting research tag (in red)

* Find a way to embded Jupyter notebooks in the post: that would be cool

* How can one add a shared on Twitter, Facebook button? e.g.: https://elc.github.io/posts/embed-interactive-notebooks/#topbar

* Improve blog-entries.json. Also, automatically detect if it has thumbnail by looking in the preamble.

* Place low resolution images while full image loading to avoid layout shifting.


__IDEA__ for GitHub project to boost stars. Make a small web app/plugin which counts the number of words written in each blog post and plots a graph of the progress made. Some basic statistics on the number of words written in a period of time. Should automatically detect date in a post. Hopefully people like it and want to collaborate.
