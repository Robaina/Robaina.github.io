# Some stuff I want to do
* Add a more interesting artwork to home page
* Add MTA paper as abandoned/interesting research tag (in red)
* Blog!
* Sort entries by date or by topic tag. Js could look at tag and sort elements accordingly.
* Add suggested readings section after blog post. This can be done by including a sample of posts with similar topic tags. Say random sample of size n.
