# Some stuff I want to do
1. Add a more interesting artwork to home page
2. Align research items
3. Add research section containing unfinished but yet interesting work, i.e., metabolite dynamics, symmetries, turnover times.
4. Perhaps makes more sense to put all research projects in the same grid, or separate them by year? Then add tags: published, submitted, ongoing, limbo.
