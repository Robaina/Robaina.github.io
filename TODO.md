# Some stuff I want to do
* Add a more interesting artwork to home page
* Add MTA paper as abandoned/interesting research tag (in red)
* Sticky navbar does not work on Firefox...
* Perhaps remove transitions among pages, the icon part, and put instead a permanent icon at the top left corner. Pressing the icon could trigger something, like navigating to the about section, or something funny like changing the artwork.
* Find a way to embded Jupyter notebooks in the post: that would be cool
* Perhaps add arrow button on scroll down to return up, and perhaps remove sticky navbar (solving Firefox issue)
* How can one add a shared on Twitter, Facebook button? e.g.: https://elc.github.io/posts/embed-interactive-notebooks/#topbar
* Also, remember to add comments section, probably easiest to start with disqus and see how it goes.
* I would like to be able to write blog drafts and store them while working on them. Ideally only the article part, not the whole html. Then, once finished, I could run a python program to insert the article into an html in the posts folder.
* Should dedicate a folder to each blog entry, to host pictures in there rather than in imgs?
* Install npm install live-server -g It solves the issue of catching and apparently updates the page as soon as you save file with changes, no need to refresh.
* Improve blog-entries.json. Append new entries instead of going through the whole list and make sure entries are sorted by date in the json. Also, automatically detect if it has thumbnail by looking in the preamble.
* Parse md files which are not ready even if html exists (for debugging purposes). Look in preamble for this.
