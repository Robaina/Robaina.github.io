# Some stuff I want to do
* Add a more interesting artwork to home page
* Add MTA paper as abandoned/interesting research tag (in red)
* Add suggested readings section after blog post. This can be done by including a sample of posts with similar topic tags. Say random sample of size n.
* Add background color to navbar upon scrolling down. Possibly in some sort of animation like fading in. You can use:
```<element onscroll="myScript">```
* Allow pdf documents!! CV.pdf not in GitHub
