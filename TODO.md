# Some stuff I want to do
* Add a more interesting artwork to home page
* Add MTA paper as abandoned/interesting research tag (in red)
* Blog!
* Add suggested readings section after blog post. This can be done by including a sample of posts with similar topic tags. Say random sample of size n.
* Consider adding background to research items, similar format as in the blog section
* Fix the thumbnail margin issue with the tags, so they align with thumbnail border
* Consider changing border color of blog entries on hovering, to FancyColor.
* Look into css/js solutions for mansonry layout, that's what you want.
