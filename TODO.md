# Some stuff I want to do
* Add a more interesting artwork to home page
* Add MTA paper as abandoned/interesting research tag (in red)

* Add suggested readings section after blog post. This can be done by including a sample of posts with similar topic tags. Say random sample of size n. Currently half implemented. Still need to remove same post from suggested readings and create a random sample if there is a sufficient number of posts within the topic.

* Sticky navbar does not work on Firefox...
* Make python program to automatically update blog-entries.json
