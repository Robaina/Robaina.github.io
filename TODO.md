# Some stuff I want to do
* Add a more interesting artwork to home page
* Add MTA paper as abandoned/interesting research tag (in red)
* Sticky navbar does not work on Firefox...
* Perhaps remove transitions among pages, the icon part, and put instead a permanent icon at the top left corner. Pressing the icon could trigger something, like navigating to the about section, or something funny like changing the artwork.
* Find a way to embded Jupyter notebooks in the post: that would be cool
* Perhaps add arrow button on scroll down to return up, and perhaps remove sticky navbar (solving Firefox issue)
* How can one add a shared on Twitter, Facebook button? e.g.: https://elc.github.io/posts/embed-interactive-notebooks/#topbar

* Improve blog-entries.json. Append new entries instead of going through the whole list and make sure entries are sorted by date in the json. Also, automatically detect if it has thumbnail by looking in the preamble.
* Parse md files which are not ready even if html exists (for debugging purposes). Look in preamble for this.

* Place low resolution images while full image loading to avoid layout shifting.
