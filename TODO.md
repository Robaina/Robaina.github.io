# Some stuff I want to do
* Add a more interesting artwork to home page
* Add MTA paper as abandoned/interesting research tag (in red)
* Sticky navbar does not work on Firefox...
* Perhaps remove transitions among pages, the icon part, and put instead a permanent icon at the top left corner. Pressing the icon could trigger something, like navigating to the about section, or something funny like changing the artwork.
