       Hiring a Ph.D. is good for your business

      <p>There is a trend across countries: most Ph.D. graduates don't continue in Academia. Simply, there aren't enough academic positions for all the Ph.Ds we are currently producing. However, a person with a Ph.D. has gained many useful skills which are transferable to other jobs. Although, in my experience, these skills are highly underappreciated outside Academia. Consequently, oftentimes Ph.Ds are not considered for certain positions in industry.</p>
<p>But that's a mistake, a Ph.D. can do way more things than being a scholar in a dusty room, surrounded by papers and lab equipment. In fact, you should <em>hire</em> a Ph.D. Having successfully earned a Ph.D. — in any field — after years of hard work requires mastering a series of very useful, transferable-to-industry skills. These are:</p>
<h4>Resilience to failure</h4>
<p>A major part of the time spent earning a Ph.D. is about dealing with failure. That's just normal. Hypotheses are proven wrong more often than they are proven right. Experiments fail. A Ph.D. won't be scared away by failure. Instead, she or he will start over again with a new idea, a new way to solve the problem at hand.</p>
<h4>Auto-organization and proactivity</h4>
<p>While some Ph.D. programs include some classes and all include supervision, the major part of Ph.D. work is still done by the student, alone, with minor guidance. Ph.Ds learn how to organize their work schedule and to reach out for the resources that are needed at any given time.</p>
<h4>Readiness to learn new stuff</h4>
<p>Ph.Ds are used to continuously update themselves in the state-of-the-art methods and knowledge in their fields, otherwise they perish miserably. Hence, a Ph.D. will quickly adapt and learn whatever new method is required to solve your business problem.</p>
<h4>Management of the unknown</h4>
<p>This skill, related to <em>Resilience to failure</em>, is very important to successfully deal with complex situations. A Ph.D. is confortable with the unknown, or at least the partially known. A Ph.D. won't get blocked when facing uncertainty. Instead, she or he will figure out creative ways to deal with it and go on. After all, research is mostly dealing with uncertainty and the unknown!</p>
<h4>Writing and communication skills</h4>
<p>Well, communicating results is as much an important part of academic work as it is generating them. Ph.Ds learn to effectively communicate their findings, both, in written form through journal articles, as well as orally through the many presentations they have to give in department meetings and conferences. Not to mention the experience explaining their research in jargon-free terms to all these curious family members and friends!</p>
<h4>Critical and rational thinking, and analytical skills</h4>
<p>Facing complex problems, oftentimes with very little information at first, requires critical and rational thinking. Moreover, these days is very likely that a Ph.D. will also know how to program in at least one scripting language — since computation have become a critical tool in Science due to the large amount of data that are being generated.</p>
<h4>An excellent understanding of the scientific method</h4>
<p>A major goal of training to become a Ph.D. is excelling at applying the scientific method. Propose your hypotheses, test them with experiments, modify the hypotheses based on results, repeat. Sounds simple, but mastering the scientific method requires practice. Particularly, doing it in an unbiased way. Letting go of ideas that are just wrong and embracing new ones that better fit the data.</p>
<h4>Creativity</h4>
<p>Perhaps one of the less known skills outside Academia. A Ph.D. is a creative person! One must be creative to come up with all these hypotheses and different ways to design experiments and find solutions to the many problems that Ph.Ds face. In fact, many scientists are also artists in one way or another.</p>
<p>So, there you go. All the previous skills are transferable skills that all Ph.Ds, <strong>independently of their field of study</strong>, gain during their training.</p>
<p>I have seen countless times dismissive messages in job ads of the sort: apply only with hands-on, <em>not academic</em>, experience. I have even learned about colleagues hiding that they have a Ph.D. when applying for certain jobs. That's nonsense. I understand that an employer would prefer hiring someone with some experience in their type of industry. Sounds reasonable. But, I tell you, learning domain-specific stuff is not complicated. Particularly for someone who is used to learn new stuff, used to change, like a Ph.D. In my opinion, it's way more useful for any business to hire someone with the skills that a Ph.D. have acquired through years of hard, methodical work.</p>
<p>So, next time think twice before rejecting a Ph.D. applying for a position in industry. They have a lot to offer, and they could be the missing piece required for your business to flourish!</p>
