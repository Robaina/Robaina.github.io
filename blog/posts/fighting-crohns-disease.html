      <p>Today is one of these days in which I feel broken. I've been living with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease">Crohn's disease</a> for at least seven years. I got used to it, or rather accustomed to the symptoms. I learned to withstand the pain — a sharp pain like I had broken glass pieces in my gut. I learned to be extremely careful with the foods I eat. And to bear the hunger while I fast for some time to ease the pain, to let my gut heal a bit. I learned to avoid crowded places and unnecessary human contact to minimize the chances of getting sick. Still, I get sick more often than I wished because of the immune suppressors I take. I have even got used to the fact that this disease is incurable, to the multiple Hospital visits, and that, likely, I will need further surgeries to continue alive — I have had four so far.</p>
<p>What I still don't get used to is how I feel on days like today: exhausted from the moment I wake up. Deprived of vital energy. I feel like I just had run a marathon and only had sufficient energy left to breathe. My body just wants to stay in bed all day and do nothing. And yet, I somehow have to manage and do my <em>normal</em> life stuff like anyone else. Wake up. Get ready. Go to work. Try to focus the best I can. Just bear with the fatigue throughout the day.</p>
<p>That's hard, but I keep having hope. I trust that this time will be like the previous one. And that next week I'll feel better. That my life will be easier. I'll manage to get some of my energy back. I wish for a nice scenario, something simple to fix. Perhaps this time I have anemia again. In that case, an iron infusion in the Hospital will help. Perhaps vitamin B-12 levels got low. That can be solved with a simple shot. If neither of these is the case, I'll still be positive. I'll wait until I feel better and, meanwhile, continue with my life the best I can. Enjoying every little moment of it.</p>
