      <p>Today is one of those days in which I feel broken. I've been living with severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease">Crohn's disease</a> for at least 7 years now. I got used to it. Rather accustomed to the symptoms. I learned to bear pain — a sharp pain like I had broken glass pieces in my gut. I learned to be extremely careful with the foods I eat. And to bear the hunger while I fast for some days to ease the pain and let my gut heal a bit. I learned to avoid crowded places and unnecessary human contact to minimize the chances of getting sick. Still, I get sick more often than I wished because of the immune suppressors I take. I have even get used to the fact that this disease is incurable, and that very likely I will need further surgeries to continue alive — I have had three so far.</p>
<p>What I still don't get used to is how I feel on days like today: exhausted from the moment I wake up. Deprived of vital energy. I feel like I just had run a marathon and only had sufficient energy left to breathe. My body just wants to stay in bed all day and do nothing. And yet, I somehow have to manage and do my <em>normal</em> life stuff like anyone else. Wake up. Get ready. Go to work. Try to focus the best I can. Bear through the day. But I suck at it. How can I ever be professionally competitive like this? How can I continue being positive about my life? I often ask myself in days like today.</p>
<p>I don't have an eloquent answer. I guess I just keep having hope. I trust that this time will be like the previous. And that in some days I will feel better. That my life will be easier. I'll manage to get some of my energy back. I wish for a nice scenario, something simple to fix. Perhaps this time I have anemia again. In that case, an infusion of iron in the Hospital will help. Perhaps vitamin B-12 levels got low. That can be solved with a simple injection. If neither of these is the case, then I just have the hope left. I'll wait to feel better and, meanwhile, continue with my life the best I can.</p>
