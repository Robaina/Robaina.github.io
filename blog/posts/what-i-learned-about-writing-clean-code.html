     <article id="blog-content">
      <p>I'm a classically trained molecular biologist. I never took any programming or coding lessons. I learned to code by myself, out of necessity. Even though this is entirely possible these days, with all the multiple resources available online, I always felt that I lacked a solid background. That I was missing on something, some tricks that I wouldn't know and most importantly, some general practices that would facilitate my life as an incipient programmer. One of the things that I lacked was a solid base on good coding practices. Practices which would guarantee the production of clean, organized, easy-to-follow code.</p>
<p>I started coding my programs in long scripts. I was only interested in the result. As long as the script worked and solved my problem, I didn't see an issue with it. I never paid attention to stuff like the readability of my code, or the capacity to quickly find bugs and isolate corrupt sections in the code. This philosophy was just fine for the small projects I was doing at the time. However, I often wouldn't have the slightest idea about how my code worked when I revisited it after some time. I just took this as a fact of the programmer's life. Something to deal with, take a coffee and expend a couple of hours deciphering the meaning of all these variables in my long script. Normal life stuff.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I read <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/">Clean Code</a>: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship, by Robert C. Martin, that I realized how <em>dirty</em> my code was. This book provided me with base knowledge about good coding practices. Even though all examples in the book are based on Java, the information there is general enough to be applied to any programming language. In this post, I'm summarizing the points that helped me the most, in the hopes that it will be useful to those still struggling with long, undecipherable scripts. I'll use some Python snippets to help me illustrate the ideas. Hope you enjoy it!</p>
<h2>1. Is all about names</h2>
<p>Giving meaningful and consistent names to the objects you create is perhaps the most important tip. Oftentimes, I found myself naming variables and functions with very short, cryptic names. Typically, I would write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="python">  def PerfectNumbers(N):
      # find all perfect numbers smaller than N
      P = []
      for k in range(1, N):
          # find proper divisors of k
          D = []
          for i in range(1, k):
              if (round(k / i) - (k / i)) == 0:
                  D.append(i)
          if sum(D) == k:
              P.append(k)
      return P
</code></pre>
<p>What is this function for? Well, it has something to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number">perfect numbers</a> by looking at the name, but the function it's not clearly written. We need to read the comment line to realize that it finds all perfect numbers smaller than <em>N</em>. Instead of this, give objects names that describe what the object <em>is</em>. It's preferable to use long names that describe the object than using short but cryptic ones. This way, there is no room for confusion; one knows what the object is about just by reading the name. Additionally, we can differentiate between inanimate objects, such as numbers or arrays, and functions or methods — which perform an action on other objects — by using verbs. For instance, it's common practice to start a function name by a verb that describes the action it performs follow by the object of this action. Applying these ideas to the previous example we obtain:</p>
<pre><code class="python">  def findPerfectNumbersSmallerThan(N):
      perfect_numbers = []
      for k in range(1, N):
          # find proper divisors of k
          proper_divisors_of_k = []
          for n in range(1, k):
              if (round(k / n) - (k / n)) == 0:
                  proper_divisors_of_k.append(n)
          if sum(proper_divisors_of_k) == k:
              perfect_numbers.append(k)
      return perfect_numbers
</code></pre>
<p>First, we now explain what the function does in the name itself, instead of using the previous (unnecessary) comment line. Note that I always start the verb with lowercase to further differentiate functions from other objects. This way a quick look at the name tells me that an object is a function and directs me towards what it does. Second, we use descriptive names for the two previous Python lists (arrays). This small change is sufficient to make a big difference. A quick look at the code is now sufficient to know that the function finds all perfect numbers smaller than <em>N</em>, and it is computing and storing proper divisors in the process. We can further improve this function, though, we'll do it in no time.</p>
<h2>2. Functions should be small</h2>
<p>I created very long functions in the old days, containing tens of lines of code, multiple arguments and typically performing multiple tasks; one or two gigantic functions would perform most of the workflow in my script. Why is that a bad practice? I see two main reasons. First, a giant function may work just fine, but you will most likely get lost when coming back to it to figure out what is doing. This is particularly important during debugging when you will hopelessly jump from one line to another — just to realize that you made a typo in that variable definition at the beginning. Second, making smaller functions facilitates modularity and function recycling in your code. In many occasions, functions can be partitioned into subroutines which are basic enough to be re-used, either in other parts of your project or in future projects. For instance, we can quickly realize that the previous function <em>findPerfectNumbersSmallerThan</em> uses a subroutine to compute the proper divisors of a number, namely:</p>
<pre><code class="python">  def findProperDivisorsOf(k):
      proper_divisors_of_k = []
      for n in range(1, k):
          if (round(k / n) - (k / n)) == 0:
              proper_divisors_of_k.append(n)
      return proper_divisors_of_k
</code></pre>
<p>We have identified the subroutine and group it into a function, which we can then call inside <em>findPerfectNumbersSmallerThan</em> — in the process, we also removed the unnecessary comment line describing what the subroutine was doing. However, now we can also call <em>findProperDivisorsOf</em> as a standalone function whenever we need it. As a side note, we can take advantage of Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions">list comprehension</a> to further simplify the previous syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="python">  def findProperDivisorsOf(k):
    return [n for n in range(1, k) if (round(k / n) - (k / n)) == 0]
</code></pre>
<p>Altogether, our original function now reads:</p>
<pre><code class="python">  def findPerfectNumbersSmallerThan(N):
      perfect_numbers = []
      for k in range(1, N):
          proper_divisors_of_k = findProperDivisorsOf(k)
          if sum(proper_divisors_of_k) == k:
              perfect_numbers.append(k)
      return perfect_numbers
</code></pre>
<p>How small functions should be? Well, Robert C. Martin says that functions should ideally perform a single task and occupy a handful of lines. I find this a bit too restrictive for everyday scripts. I would say that functions should perform as few tasks as possible. Sometimes makes more sense for a function to perform a coupled of small related tasks rather than split the function into two tiny functions. Still, the general idea makes sense.</p>
<h2>3. Group related functions in higher categories</h2>
<p>Now that we have split our long script into a bunch of small functions, we will find that probably many of them are related. For instance, they may be all subroutines which together perform a single task, or they may share some arguments. In this case, it makes sense to group related functions in a larger category. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)">Classes</a> are the broader categories that are typically employed in object-oriented programming. However, this is not the only way to group functions. If you are a Python user, you probably organize your code into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html">Python modules</a>. Python modules are files containing a bunch of related Python statements (at least as related as you made them), such as functions and other object declarations, and which you can import into your workspace. Additionally, any variable which is declared at the beginning of the module becomes accessible to all the functions in that module, which in a way plays the role of class attributes. If neither of these features is available to you, it still makes sense to group related functions in thematic scripts. Certainly, it will make your code easier to follow by organizing it in a conceptual framework.</p>
<h2>4. Write meaningful conditional expressions</h2>
<p>Conditional expressions are all over the place. And no wonder about that, they endow our code with the ability to be responsive, to behave differently depending on the circumstances. However, sometimes it's hard to understand what a conditional expression is evaluating, particularly when it's composed of several conditions. In these cases, turning a conditional expression into a small function or a variable with a smart name can greatly simplify the code.</p>
<p>Let's consider an example. In <em>findPerfectNumbersSmallerThan</em> there is a conditional expression; it's the part in which we test whether or not a number is perfect — namely if the sum of proper divisors amounts to that number. However, why assume that our reader knows what a perfect number is? We can create a simple Boolean function which tests if a number is perfect, and then invoke it in the conditional expression:</p>
<pre><code class="python">  def is_perfect_number(k):
      proper_divisors_of_k = findProperDivisorsOf(k)
      return sum(proper_divisors_of_k) == k

  def findPerfectNumbersSmallerThan(N):
      perfect_numbers = []
      for k in range(1, N):
          if is_perfect_number(k):
              perfect_numbers.append(k)
      return perfect_numbers
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, taking advantage of Python's list comprehension, we can further simplify our code to:</p>
<pre><code class="python">  def findPerfectNumbersSmallerThan(N):
      return [k for k in range(1, N) if is_perfect_number(k)]
</code></pre>
<p>which I think is pretty much all I can do to improve the looks of our original function. Now one only needs to glance at the code to know that <em>findPerfectNumbersSmallerThan</em> returns a list of perfect numbers smaller than <em>N</em> — the last part because we know that <em>range</em> in Python does not include the last number <em>N</em>.</p>
<p>We will, however, face more complex conditional expressions than the previous one, such as those formed by several conditions. In these cases, we can simplify the expression by assigning a Boolean function or variable to each condition. By naming the individual conditions, we go from a confusing conditional expression to a semantic one: we just need to read it to get an idea about what the conditional expression is evaluating. If we want further details, then we can go ahead and read the definitions of the individual expressions.</p>
<h2>5. Don't be afraid of line breaks</h2>
<p>Just like in regular prose, code lines that are too long are hard to read. It's better to break long lines into shorter ones. In my case, I tend to break lines at around 100 characters, which more or less corresponds to half my laptop's screen. This is because often I need to see two scripts side by side while working on my code. However, sometimes it makes sense to go for a new line even when the current one is well below the limit. One of such cases corresponds to conditional expressions like the one we saw before. When the conditional expression is formed by several conditions, it's useful to dedicate an independent line to each condition. This way we can quickly break down the conditional expression into its constituent conditions, which comes handy when trying to understand what the conditional expression is evaluating.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>Code is written for humans! That's the whole purpose of programming languages: serve as a human-readable interface between machine code and the way we humans process information. Hence, it makes sense to treat code like any other piece of writing and make an effort to increase readability. I have found that caring about making my code look clean(er) worth the extra time expended. These practices greatly reduce the time required to understand your script, either by someone else or by you after some time. It also facilitates debugging and most likely reduces the number of bugs in your code by establishing a logical, semantic structure. Finally, I don't expect you to apply all these tips at once. Typically, I begin writing code that works. Later on, I edit — refactor in the jargon — the code to make it look cleaner. Again much like regular prose, in which one first would write the bulk of a text and then polish it during edition. So, next time you find yourself in front of a monstrous, hardy-readable script, give it a try and put some order into that mess. You won't regret it!</p>
