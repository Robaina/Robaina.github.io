       What is Systems Biology?

     <article id="blog-content">
      <p>In September 2017 I earned a Ph.D. degree in Systems Biology. Since then, I often find myself explaining what Systems Biology is when someone asks about my doctorate. While the field of Systems Biology has been around for at least 15 years now, I have seen that it's still not very well known. This is my attempt at explaining what Systems Biology is and what is not. There are already many definitions of Systems Biology out there, so I'll try to keep this post simple and summarize the main points. First, a brief historical introduction.</p>
<p>The field of Systems Biology started somewhere in the early 2000s, coinciding with the advent of the so-called high-throughput — a word that I misspell 50% of the time — technologies. Namely, the capacity to measure hundreds or thousands of biological parameters in a single experiment. Producing an amount of data never before dealt with in Biology. At the same time, computing power and storage capacity of personal computers had reached a decent level. Making computation with and handling of large datasets readily accessible to researchers.</p>
<h2>Systems Biology focuses on the whole picture</h2>
<p>The previous technological advances allowed shifting the focus from individual cellular components, such as single genes, proteins or metabolic pathways, to studying the relations between hundreds or thousands of components in diverse cellular systems. From uncovering molecular details to analyzing the cellular landscape. In short, from a reductionist approach to a wholistic one. This paradigm shift embraced understanding how properties of the collective interactions of molecular components emerge, as well as how perturbations in these interactions propagate throughout the system. However, it's worth pointing out that Systems Biology would not be possible without all the knowledge collected through careful analysis of the details.</p>
<h2>Systems Biology is both big data and <em>in silico</em> modeling</h2>
<p>Systems Biology employs both experimental and computational or mathematical modeling techniques. Some groups are purely experimental (Experimental Systems Biology)</p>
<h2>Systems Biology is <em>not</em> Bioinformatics</h2>
<p>I have observed many colleagues puzzled when I say that I only use computational techniques. You mean you are <em>bioinformatician</em> they correct. I'll try to explain here the differences that I see between Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (I have done both). Firstly, Systems Biology and Bioinformatics do overlap when it comes to the techniques, both use computational approaches, including machine learning and mathematical modeling and optimization. In both, programming skills are a must and computers the primary lab equipment.</p>
<p>What about experimental systems biology then? The important thing here is the systemic approach. Bioinformatics uses computation and algorithms but also to study things from a very reductionist approach such as protein structures, gene sequences, alignments. Possible overlap in network science, or the development of algorithms per se. Clear difference in the fact that Systems Biology uses models to answer biological questions while Bioinformatics cares more about developing computational tools.</p>
<p>Bioinformatics would include also deep learning and machine learning techniques, since those are meant to uncover hidden relations between variables but do not provide an understanding of how the system actually works.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p>There is also this difference between narrowing down a list of candidate genes, for instance, and then going over the list with reductionist approaches to determine their function, and modeling a system with an ODE system say, and actually test hypotheses or find unexpected consequences to the dynamics. Or like I did, use a metabolic network and find an order relation. The first case aligns more with a data driven approach, and with statistics/machine learning. The second one with mathematical modeling. Both approaches are carried out within Systems Biology...</p>
