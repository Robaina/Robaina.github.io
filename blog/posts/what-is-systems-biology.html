     <article id="blog-content">
      <p>In September 2017 I earned a Ph.D. degree in Systems Biology. Since then, I often find myself explaining what Systems Biology is when someone asks about my doctorate. While the field of Systems Biology has been around for at least 15 years now, I have seen that it's still not very well known. This is my attempt at explaining what Systems Biology is and what it is not. There are already many definitions of Systems Biology out there, so I'll try to keep this post simple and summarize the main points. First, a brief historical introduction.</p>
<p>The field of Systems Biology started somewhere in the early 2000s, coinciding with the advent of the so-called high-throughput â€” a word that I misspell 50% of the time â€” technologies. Namely, the capacity to measure hundreds or thousands of biological parameters in a single experiment. Producing an amount of data never before dealt with within Biology. At the same time, computing power and storage capacity of personal computers had reached a decent level. Making computation with and handling of large datasets readily accessible to researchers.</p>
<h2>Systems Biology focuses on the whole picture</h2>
<p>The previous technological advances allowed shifting the focus from individual cellular components, such as single genes, proteins, or metabolic pathways, to studying the relations between hundreds or thousands of components in diverse cellular systems. From uncovering molecular details to analyzing the cellular landscape. In short, from a reductionist approach to a holistic one. This paradigm shift embraced understanding how properties of the collective interactions of molecular components emerge, as well as how perturbations in these interactions propagate throughout the system. This being said, Systems Biology would not be possible without all the knowledge collected through careful analysis of the details provided by classical, reductionist approaches.</p>
<h2>Systems Biology is interdisciplinary and employs diverse techniques</h2>
<p>Systems Biology is interdisciplinary, and the main reason for this need is the wide array of techniques that are employed when biology is studied at a systemic level. On the one hand, we need wet lab experts who can design experiments and produce large-scale data sets of biological parameters. On the other hand, we need computational experts, who can analyze these huge data sets, find hidden patterns, and build mathematical models to make sense of them. Moreover, both experimentalists and computational experts must understand each other. So, it's a great discipline to improve your communication skills!</p>
<h2>Systems Biology is <em>not</em> Bioinformatics</h2>
<p>I have observed many colleagues puzzled when I say that I only used computational techniques during my Ph.D. studies. You mean you are a <em>bioinformatician</em>, they correct me. Well, I have done both, to be honest, and even had the chance to choose whether I wanted to graduate as a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics or a Ph.D. in Systems Biology. However, there are two main differences. First, and rather obviously, Bioinformatics is all about developing and applying algorithms and computational methods to solve biological problems. There are no experimental techniques like in Systems Biology. Second, a bioinformatician tackles problems with both a reductionist or a holistic approach. For instance, a typical bioinformatics problem is to figure out how a protein will move based on its sequence â€” a reductionist approach. Another one is to reconstruct a gene-gene interaction network for all known genes in a given species based on experimental data â€” a holistic approach.</p>
<p>So, in short, you could say that I graduated as a Computational Systems Biologist, or as a Bioinformatician interested in understanding how biological systems work ðŸ™ƒ.</p>
