# Things I want to write about
* Fibonacci numbers plus generalization
* Static Jupyter widgets: my contribution with an example
* How I made this website/blog
* Vitamins and cofactors: what they are, how are they produced, why are they so weird metabolites
* What's important to unravel in Biology? Discerning universal patterns
* Role of diffusion and spatial localization in metabolism
* A generalization of life, defining life
* The Charnes-Cooper transformation, generalized Charnes-Cooper
* Why I like convex optimization: the fun of expressing optimization problems as convex ones
* The life of an oceanic Island: Carracedo and the Canary Islands, with comparison to Hawaii
* The power of writing and why I suck at it.
* An introductory post about this blog
* A post about Gilbert's syndrome: connection to metabolism and deficiencies
* A post about Crohn's disease?
* I guess, a post about mathematical modeling of metabolism?
* Why languages are awesome: connections to biological evolution and to human perception
* General tips about making a website/blog that I have learnt: making urls, organizing project, etc
* Brief tips that I learnt about keeping clean, readable code (after reading Clean code by this guy)
* A post about this magic hexagon game, how I solved it with a MILP and my generalization: the magic-gon. Probably good opportunity to port code to JavaScript.
* A post about the dependency graph generated from Euclid's Elements and link to application. That's so cool...

# Tips to writing engaging blogs
* Add a call to action to each post such as, "if you enjoyed this post, please share in Twitter/Facebook" or "please leave a comment or drop me a line!"

# Writing in markdown
1. Go through all md files and check which one doesn't have a html version in posts
2. Create an html version
3. Integrate these scripts with the one updating the JSON data
