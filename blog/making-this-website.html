            <p>I have been wanting to make my own personal website since I started my PhD. I knew it was something important to have, but I just couldn't find the time to do it. Now that I have more time, I have decided to go for it! I could have easily built my website using some content management system, or I could have employed some available website template, or even use one of the several available JavaScript libraries to help me do it. However, I wanted to build a website from scratch. That is, using pure HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavasCript. Partly because I wanted to learn more during the process, but also to prove to myself that I was able to do it&msdash;somehow building a website seemed like a mysterious process to me, oftentimes I was told that I wouldn't be able to make a website without professional help. I can help it, I like a challenge.</p>

            <p>In short, building your own website from scratch without being an expert is not even possible, but it can also be quite entertaining too! </p>
