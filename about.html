          <h1>Hi there</h1>

          <p>and welcome to my site! I find it really hard to reduce myself to a couple of words during introductions. Let's say for now that I'm a curious, sentient being, born and raised in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands">Canary Islands</a>, Spain (great place). I can only think of one invariant when it comes to my personal interests and the stuff that I have done: a strong passion to learn more about and get involved in everything that I find interesting at the time (sometimes sort-of-life-long passions, other times temporary ones). </p>

          <p>This personal webpage is an experiment. I plan to use this site to share part of who I am and what I do. Consequently, I will be writing about a variety of topics such as (though not limited to), biology, math, physics, geology, chemistry, art, music, coding, data science, statistics, literature, distillation of my own understanding of the universe... I must apologize for that already: I know that we live in a society of specialization, but focusing in a single topic makes me sad. Additionally, I haven't made my mind about making this site fully bilingual or not. (That would be in English, the language I have used most at work, and Spanish, my mother tongue.) For the moment, I may include some posts in the <a href="blog.html">Blog</a> section in Spanish alongside other ones in English.</p>

          <p>I hope that you enjoy and find some of the content of this site useful. If you are interested in my formal education and research do take a look at my <a href="/assets/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> and <a href="/research.html">scientific publications</a>. If, on the other hand, you are curious about the kind of stuff that I do for fun, pay a visit to my <a href="blog.html">Blog</a> and the <a href="web.html">web Apps</a> that I have made. That's all for now...</p>

          <p>¡Hasta pronto!</p>
