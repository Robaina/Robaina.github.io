      <h1>Hi there...</h1>

      <p>and welcome to my site! First of all, a disclaimer: This personal webpage is an experiment. Indeed, I plan to use this site as a means to publicize part of who I am and what I do. However, to do so, I must violate a couple of well-known rules in the business. Particularly, (i) you won't find a coherent collection of topics in here, I will rather be writing about disparate topics such as biology, math, physics, geology, chemistry, art, music, coding, data science, statistics, literature... and (ii) I will write in both, English, the language that I have used most at work, and in Spanish, my mother tongue and my preferred language to write literature. I know that this behavior is absolutely not recommended to attract readers, but I can't help it, hence the experiment.</p>

      <p>I hope that you enjoy and find some of the content of this site useful. If you are interested in my formal education and research do take a look at my <a href="/assets/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> and <a href="/research.html">scientific publications</a>. If, on the other hand, you are curious about the kind of stuff that I do for fun, I recommend a visit to my <a href="blog.html">Blog</a> and the <a href="web.html">web Apps</a> that I have made. That's all for now...</p>

      <p>Cheers!</p>
